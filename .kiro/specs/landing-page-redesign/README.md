- **Framer Motion** (recommended) - Animation library
- **Intersection Observer API** - Scroll detection
- **CSS Custom Properties** - Dynamic theming

## 📊 Performance Targets

- ⚡ **60fps** animations
- 🎯 **LCP < 2.5s** (Largest Contentful Paint)
- 🚀 **FID < 100ms** (First Input Delay)
- 📏 **CLS < 0.1** (Cumulative Layout Shift)
- ♿ **WCAG 2.1 AA** accessibility compliance

## 🎨 Design Principles

1. **Modern but Professional** - Cutting-edge without being gimmicky
2. **Animated but Accessible** - Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
3. **Engaging but Performant** - 60fps target for all animations
4. **Futuristic but Usable** - Innovation doesn't sacrifice UX
5. **Beautiful but Fast** - Visual appeal with excellent Core Web Vitals
